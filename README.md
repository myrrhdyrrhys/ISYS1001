Database Systems (Year 2, Semester 2)

An introduction to database systems, the concept of relational models, entity relations (ER) diagrams and relational mapping, and the use of Structured Query Language (SQL). An interesting unit as I hadn't really had to deal with SQL before and the way you could manipulate data based on attributes.

This repository contains an assignment that asked us to import data from the 2020 Olympics and manipulate it in certain ways to show our proficiency in querying. Rather than a README.txt, the assignment required us to write a formal "User Guide" (located in the repository) to show a user step-by-step how to operate the database.
